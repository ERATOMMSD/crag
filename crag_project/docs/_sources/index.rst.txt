Welcome to CRAG's API documentation!
====================================

CRAG is a tool that generates road geometries for testing the lane keeping components of automated driving systems. CRAG relies on combinatorial testing with parameters of the combinatorial model representing high-level features of the road like "long segment", "short segment", "medium turn", and "sharp turn".

CRAG provides a standalone executable crag that allows one to run CRAG and communicate with it through standard input and output.

CRAG also provides a library of functions that can be used in other python projects. This documentation provides necessary API information for using CRAG as a library.

When you click Module Index below, you can see the submodules of CRAG. For the main class of CRAG, check crag.crag; for handling test suite generator backends, check crag.tsgenerator, crag.acts, crag.cagen, and crag.pict; for generation of concrete roads from road configurations check crag.roadgeometry.
